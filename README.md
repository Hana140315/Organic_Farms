## 1- Introduction:
Lifestyle changed from time to time, recently the whole world starts back to nature trying to sustain the earth and natural resources.  I mean that they try to live based with consideration to reduce harms on the environments and the impact of their activities on nature, as we all know about the problem of the global warm and the ozone layer. In addition to try to reduce health problems and chronic diseases. For all of that they start searching about the reasons causing these problems. 
In Palestine we used to have green lifestyle to the time the international free trade agreement signed, but many people keep following the traditional lifestyle and food production in parallel to other product needed on a daily base.
 For that many farms are following the Bio” Baladi” in producing their products 
 We could consider our project as an idea that would help society live in a more sustainable way and classified as “going green” a reality. The impact of implementing our project will enhance the following:

1.	Reducing carbon emissions
2.	Helping protect endangered species
3.	Reducing pollution or helping clean local neighborhoods or cities
4.	Ensuring everyone has access to healthy food to eat
5.	Preventing deforestation or driving reforestation
6.	Improving waste disposal
7.	Improving the recycling process or recycling adoption

## 2-	Project Scope:
