Lifestyle changed from time to time, recently the whole world starts back to nature trying to sustain the earth and natural resources.  I mean that they try to live based with consideration to reduce harms on the environments and the impact of their activities on nature, as we all know about the problem of the global warm and the ozone layer. In addition to try to reduce health problems and chronic diseases. For all of that they start searching about the reasons causing these problems. 
In Palestine we used to have green lifestyle to the time the international free trade agreement signed, but many people keep following the traditional lifestyle and food production in parallel to other product needed on a daily base.
 For that many farms are following the Bio” Baladi” in producing their products
